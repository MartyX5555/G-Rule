# What's this
The Measurer, rule or simply GRule is a specialized, high grade, measuring tool, with different modes and units to use by the user.

This was done as goal to *actually get a proper rule tool* that can measure in both playerscale and mapscale and not *faking the units massively* as some tools do, besides, considering the point of making the task less tedious.
# Features

This tool, apart of obviously getting the distance between 2 points, also provides:
- A **very ultra wide** list of units to convert from (Want astronomical units or Terameters? go ahead).
- A correct mapscale-playerscale conversion (1 unit = 0.75 inch / 1 unit = 1 inch respectively).
- Different modes for different tasks. Get thickness of a wall or the space between 2 walls in 1-2 clicks. No more tricks.
- InfMap Support. The renders won't break beyond the initial chunk. Feel free to measure and render astronomical units if you want.

# Installation

To install this, you can directly download the ZIP and extract it into addons folder (likely to be located at garrysmod/addons).

Also, you can get this tool directly from the workshop (waiting for link)

# Notes

- When getting distances too large, make sure to increase the decimal count to avoid misconceptions of the values (1 Megameter is 1000 km, but rounding it to 0 decimals means 0.5 Mm becomes 1 Mm)
- In InfMap, certain trace-based modes wont work beyond the chunk where it was performed. If you want to get distance across many chunks, use the Entity to Entity or basic modes.
