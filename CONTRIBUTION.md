# Code Contribution

You are free to contribute to this project, i'm mostly fine and happy with all the contributions, as long as they follow these simple guidelines:

1. Don't use Garry operators. This is stuff like //, &&, !A, etc.
2. Use tabs and not spaces when identing. 4 tab size is the one used in this project.
3. Dirty and low effort changes are mostly ignored (includes massive harcoding without a clear reason)
4. Don't use deprecated or unoptimized functions or methods.
5. Use a linter to ensure your code has not unnecesary whitespaces or inconsistencies. [Glua linter is a good one](https://github.com/FPtje/GLuaFixer)

# Language Contribution

This addon has localization support. If your language is not in the tool and you wish to add it. You can do it.

And rather than guldelines, some considerations:

1. The resulting translation should look as native as possible. Robotic-like or google translated words will make the translation to feel poor.
2. The G-Rule word should remain untranslated since thats the name of the addon and it will serve to indicate the g-rule tool belongs to it. To avoid confusion.
3. Its possible some words can be longer than the intended space for the term for other languages. If you find any issue regarding to this, contact me.
4. Take your time. No one is pressing to you in order to make it. A well done translation will be better than a bad one.

And once you read  these points, now [read this page about how you can make it](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Addon_Localization#propertiesfiles) and [take this sample](https://github.com/MartyX5555/G-Rule/blob/main/resource/localization/en/grule.properties).

When you finish your localization, create a pull request!
